# ToDoCore

The simplest educational application is a To-do list using CoreData and UIImagePickerController. 

The base entity contains a string value, an integer value, and an image in the form of binary data. 

After creating a To-do list item, the data is saved and deleted after clicking the Done button or deleting the corresponding table cell by swipe.
